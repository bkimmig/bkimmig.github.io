My name is Brian Kimmig, I am from Salt Lake City, Utah. I have previously lived
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and most recently Portland, Oregon. In my spare time
I enjoy reading and doing just about anything outdoors - especially if I can
bring my dog Charlie.

For work, I'm passionate about both machine learning and getting the models into
a highly scalable production environment.  Currently I'm working on improving
the lending experience via search and personalization at
[kiva.org](https://www.kiva.org/).
