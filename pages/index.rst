        <h3> About Me </h3>
        
        I am from Salt Lake City, Utah and am currently living in Portland, Oregon. In my spare time I enjoy reading and doing just about anything outdoors - especially if I can bring my dog Charlie.

        I obtained by bachelors degree in physics in 2012. I then spent a few years doing research in Astrophysics - mostly stuff in the local galaxy involving kinematics and chemical compositions of stars. It was during this time that I found an interest in computer science, stats, and machine learning; eventually landing in a master's program for computer science at the University of Utah. In Portland, I have been working as somewhat of a hybrid software engineer and data scientist at <a href="https://www.vacasa.com/">Vacasa</a>.
