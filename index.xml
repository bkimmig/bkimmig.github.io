We were fortunate enough to be able to deploy this in our VPC - which is the recommended way to do so. The VPC adds a nice security layer, but unfortunately still lets everything in your VPC talk to your database - which is not following best security practices. So, to lock this down a little more, we decided to only let certain user groups talk to the database.</description></item><item><title>Github Pages, GitHub Actions, and Hugo</title><link>https://bkimmig.github.io/github-pages-github-actions-and-hugo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkimmig.github.io/github-pages-github-actions-and-hugo/</guid><description>For the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve had my personal website hosted via GitHub Pages. To make my life even easier I&amp;rsquo;ve always used a static site generator; first I used Pelican and most recently had it set up with Nikola - both were great. Nikola is especially nice as it made deploying Jupyter notebooks as blog posts incredibly easy.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to mess with the style of my site a bit more.</description></item></channel></rss>
